# yasu-web

Simple web interface for Yasu AI, a simple and free api to get anime suggestions!

This repository contains only the official Web Interface for Yasu AI, unfortunatelly the backend is closed source.

## Community
The main scope if this repository is to make an example usage of the API and be the main community hub.

I invite you to take a look at:
- [Issues](https://github.com/rickycorte/yasu-web/issues)
- [Discussions](https://github.com/rickycorte/yasu-web/discussions)
- [Public Roadmap](https://github.com/rickycorte/yasu-web/projects/1)
- API Documentation (Not available in alpha due to sudden api changes)

Feel free to create an issue/discussion reguarding both the backend and the frontend!
